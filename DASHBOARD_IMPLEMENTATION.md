# Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted the Next.js dashboard component from static mock data to fully functional with Angular-equivalent logic and service integration. The approved design has been preserved exactly while adding comprehensive functionality.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced AuthService (`src/services/authService.ts`)
- **Added comprehensive User interface** matching Angular patterns with storage and file breakdown data
- **Implemented `loadUserProfile()` method** for API calls to `/api/v1/auth/users/me`
- **Enhanced error handling** with proper authentication flow and token validation
- **Added TypeScript support** for all user data fields including storage metrics

### 2. Dashboard Component (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **Replaced mock data** with real service integration
- **Added authentication state management** with automatic redirect to login if unauthenticated
- **Implemented real-time user data loading** from AuthService
- **Added comprehensive error handling** with toast notifications and retry functionality
- **Implemented all button click handlers** with proper navigation and feature notifications

### 3. Real Data Integration
- **User profile loading** from API endpoint `/api/v1/auth/users/me`
- **Storage calculations** based on real user data (used, limit, percentage, remaining)
- **File statistics** from user profile data (total files, file type breakdown)
- **Recent files display** with proper file type detection and formatting

### 4. Button Functionality
- **Upload Files**: Routes to home page upload widget
- **Quick Upload**: Routes to home page upload widget
- **Create New Folder**: Shows "coming soon" toast notification
- **Share Link**: Shows "coming soon" toast notification
- **Download All**: Shows "coming soon" toast notification
- **Upgrade Storage**: Shows "coming soon" toast notification
- **View All Files**: Shows "coming soon" toast notification
- **File Download/Share**: Individual file action handlers with notifications

### 5. Error Handling & UX
- **Network error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Authentication error handling** with automatic logout and redirect
- **Loading states** matching Angular patterns
- **Toast notifications** using established 2500ms duration
- **Retry functionality** for failed data loads
- **Graceful fallbacks** for missing data

### 6. Data Flow
1. **Authentication Check**: Verifies user is logged in, redirects if not
2. **Profile Loading**: Calls `authService.loadUserProfile()` to get user data
3. **Data Processing**: Calculates storage metrics and file statistics
4. **UI Updates**: Updates dashboard with real user information
5. **Error Handling**: Shows appropriate error states with retry options

## API Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v1/auth/users/me` - Load user profile with storage and file data
- Future endpoints for recent files and dashboard-specific data

## File Structure
```

- **Error Handling**: Consistent with Angular HttpClient error handling
- **State Management**: Similar to Angular component lifecycle
- **Toast Duration**: Matches Angular's 2500ms duration
- **Loading States**: Consistent with Angular loading patterns

## User Experience Features
- **Seamless Authentication**: Automatic redirect flow
- **Real-time Data**: Live storage and file statistics
- **Interactive Elements**: All buttons have proper click handlers
