## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:5000

# Analytics (Optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VERCEL_ANALYTICS_ID=your_id_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOTJAR_ID=your_id_here

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=DirectDriveX
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### 2. Backend API Requirements
Your backend must implement these endpoints:

#### Single File Upload
- `POST /api/upload` - Initiate single file upload
- `WS /upload` - WebSocket for progress tracking

#### Batch Upload
- `POST /api/batch-upload/initiate` - Start batch upload
- `WS /upload_parallel/{file_id}` - Individual file uploads

#### Quota Management
- `GET /api/quota` - Get user quota information

#### Authentication
- `GET /api/user/me` - Get current user info
- `POST /auth/google` - Google OAuth login
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token

### 3. WebSocket Message Format
The backend should send these message types:

```json
// Progress update
{
  "type": "progress",
  "value": 45
}

// Success
{
  "type": "success",
  "value": "file_id_123"
}

// Error
{
  "type": "error",
  "value": "File too large"
}
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### WebSocket Connection Failed
- Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` in environment
- Verify backend WebSocket endpoint is running
- Check firewall and network configuration

#### File Upload Fails
- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is correct
- Check backend API endpoints are implemented
- Verify CORS configuration on backend

#### Quota Not Loading
- Check `/api/quota` endpoint exists
- Verify authentication headers if required
- Check network tab for API errors

#### File Size Validation Issues
- Verify `validateFileSize` function is called
- Check authentication state detection
- Verify file size limits configuration

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by checking browser console:
- WebSocket connection status
- File chunk processing
- Progress updates
- Error messages

## üîÑ State Management

The component manages these states:

### Single Upload States
- `idle` - No file selected
- `selected` - File selected, ready to upload
- `uploading` - File upload in progress
- `success` - Upload completed successfully
- `error` - Upload failed
- `cancelled` - Upload was cancelled

### Batch Upload States
- `idle` - No files selected
- `selected` - Files selected, ready for batch upload
- `processing` - Batch upload in progress
- `success` - All files uploaded successfully
- `error` - Batch upload failed
- `cancelled` - Batch upload was cancelled

### File States (within batch)
- `pending` - File waiting to be uploaded
- `uploading` - File upload in progress
- `success` - File uploaded successfully
- `error` - File upload failed
